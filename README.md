# Student_Performance_Analysis_MH3511_Project

A data analysis project investigating how various factors — such as study habits, parental background, and extracurricular involvement — affect students’ academic performance. This was completed as part of the **MH3511 Data Analysis in Computer** course (AY2024/2025 Semester 2) at Nanyang Technological University.

## Project Overview

This project explores a dataset of 500 students and seeks to answer key questions such as:

- Is there a difference in the passing rates between male and female students?
- Is there a trend in the passing rates among students with low, medium, and high study hours per week?
- Does the number of study hours vary across different levels of parental education?
- How do the students' final examination scores compare to their past examination scores?
- How does parental education level influence students’ performance in the final examination?
- Does internet access at home relate to how much students improve their examination scores?
- Is there a difference in final examination performance between students participating in extracurricular activities and those not?
- Do students perform consistently across attendance rate, past and final examination scores?

We used various statistical tests and regression analysis to uncover significant relationships between the students' profiles and their final examination results.

## Methods Used

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics, histograms, boxplots
- **Statistical Tests**:
  - Chi-Squared Test
  - ANOVA Test
  - Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
  - Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test
  - Kruskal-Wallis Test
  - Friedman Rank Sum Test
- **Correlation Analysis**: Spearman’s correlation
- **Regression**: Linear regression to model predictors of final exam scores

## Key Findings

- Study hours per week significantly influence pass/fail outcomes.
- Past examination scores and attendance rate are moderately correlated with final examination scores.
- Gender, internet access at home, parental education level, and extracurricular activities showed no significant influence in the performance of a student's final examination.
